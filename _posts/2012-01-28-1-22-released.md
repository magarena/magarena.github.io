title: "1.22 released"
---

End of the month and a new release as usual. This release fixed a handful of
bugs, adds an option that hopefully makes using the game on a touchscreen
easier and adds 17 new decks for you to play around with. There's a known bug
(issue 112 - AEther Vial's and Legacy's Allure's abilities don't work) that we
hope to fix soon. A list of all changes can be found in the
[Change Log](//github.com/magarena/magarena/blob/1.22/release/README.txt).
