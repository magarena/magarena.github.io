title: "1.22 released"
---

End of the month and a new release as usual. This release fixed a handful of
bugs, adds an option that hopefully makes using the game on a touchscreen
easier and adds 17 new decks for you to play around with. There's a known bug
(issue 112 - AEther Vial's and Legacy's Allure's abilities don't work) that we
hope to fix soon. A list of all changes can be found in the
[Change Log](http://code.google.com/p/magarena/source/browse/release/README.txt?r=bda15422a9e6#55).
