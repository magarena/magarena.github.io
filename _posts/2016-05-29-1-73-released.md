title: "1.73 released"

In this release, we fixed a crash bug that occurs when activating a card
ability such as cycling. Stensia Masquerade, Anafenza, the Foremost, and
Sigarda, Heron's Grace received bug fixes thanks to bug reports from the
community. 

The following cards were added: Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, Kalitas,
Traitor of Ghet, Westvale Abbey / Ormendahl, Profane Prince, and Sylvan
Advocate.
