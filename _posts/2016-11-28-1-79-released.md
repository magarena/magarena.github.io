We now have a systematic way to identify missing cards that can refer to
existing groovy code. A number of new cards for this release was added through
this mechanism. A total of 12 new cards are included in this release.

The last release improved the speed of the AI game simulations but also
introduced a bug where a spell that affected the power/toughness of the
creatures did not have any effect. This has been fixed.
