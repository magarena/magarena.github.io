You can now play against the top decks from Project Firemind by choosing the
option "Firemind Top Decks" from the deck chooser. The first time you choose
this option, the program will download the decks from the Project Firemind site.

The rules for handling simultaneous loss has been modified. Previouly, when
both players have less than 1 life or more than 10 poison counters, the player
with the least life or most poison counters loses. Now the active player loses.
This enables players to use a suicide strategy when you are unable to lose due
to a game effect.
