title: "1.37 released"
---


This release includes two new AIs, a honest Monte Carlo Tree Search AI and a
cheating Vegas AI. We have been experimenting with an honest Monte Carlo Tree
Search AI for a while but its performance was rather poor. The breakthrough was
to use a random selection of the opponent's library as the opponent's hand
during the random playout phase of the AI.

We [benchmarked](//github.com/magarena/magarena/wiki/AIComparison) all
current AIs. The strongest is the cheating version of the Monte Carlo Tree
Search AI at level 8. Surprisingly, the honest version at level 8 is the second
strongest, outperforming even the cheating Minimax AI at level 8.
