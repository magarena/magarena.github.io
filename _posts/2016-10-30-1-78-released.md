It can be hard to remember the characteristics of permanents on the battlefield
that have been altered by an effect. For example, an effect may change the
subtype or color of existing permanents. In this release, we enabled the proxy
image generator to customize the card image for permanents based on their color
and types/subtypes.

We also cleaned up our UI code in preparation for creating a more customized
look and feel. We have included a custom scrollbar and checkbox in this
release.

In the release, we fixed 15 bugs and added 55 new cards. In particular, we
fixed a crash bug when running on some non-English locales.
