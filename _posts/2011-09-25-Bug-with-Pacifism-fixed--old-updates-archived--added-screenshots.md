title: "Bug with Pacifism fixed, old updates archived, added screenshots"
---

A creature enchanged with Pacifism could still attack due to a bug in the way the game state is copied for the AI. This has been fixed in the developer build.

Updates before 1.18 has been archived at [Archive](/archive/).

Added a screenshots section to the home page and a [Screenshots](//github.com/magarena/magarena/wiki/ThemesScreenshots) wiki page.
