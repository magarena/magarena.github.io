Time for a new release of Magarena :) We are now building releases of Magarena
using [CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com/foss)' DEV@cloud platform, 1.22 was
the first release built via Jenkin hosted on DEV@cloud.

The game now show counters for every permanent, not just for creatures, and
displays the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters. Thanks to the bug reports, we
have fixed the behavior of many cards so that they behave according to the
rules. We've also added 42 new cards and 8 new custom decks.
