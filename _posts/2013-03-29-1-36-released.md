title: "1.36 released"
---


This release adds support for the Planeswalker card type and includes 13
Planeswalkers. For those who are curious about what the AI is thinking about,
it is now possible to peak at the AI's hand using the "s" (switch view)
keyboard shortcut. The Minimax AI has been modified to use no more than "AI
level" seconds for each decision, a feature borrowed from the Monte Carlo Tree
Search AI.
