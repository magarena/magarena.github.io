We've broken the record for the number of contributors in a single release yet
again! Thanks to [Project Firemind](http://firemind.ch), submitting new cards
is easier than ever.

The most often request mechanic of searching your library is now supported.  In
this release, you'll find a cycle of lands cards for improved mana fixing. In
addition, simple "Lord" type effects can now be expressed in the card script
without the need to provide a Groovy script.
