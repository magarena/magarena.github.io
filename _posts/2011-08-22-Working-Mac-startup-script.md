title: "Working Mac startup script"

Thanks to johncpatterson from the forum, we now have a proper working Mac
startup script for launching Magarena. 

You can download the script from
[here](http://magarena.googlecode.com/files/Magarena.command.1338.zip).

Just unzip and put it into your Magarena folder, overwriting the old script.
With this new script, you can launch Magarena by double clicking the script in
the GUI. You can also add it as a shortcut to the dock. -- melvin
