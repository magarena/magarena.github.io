title: "1.50 released"
---


An experimental animation system is included in this release that shows the
full size image of the card when it is played by the AI. It is off by default,
you can enable it from Settings -> Preferences -> Gameplay. More abilities can
be scripted directly without Groovy code, such as condition gaining/granting of
abilities.
