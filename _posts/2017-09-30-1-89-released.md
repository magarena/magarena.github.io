title: "1.89 released"
---

During the last release, a change in the way magiccards.info served images
revealed a bug in the way we deal with corrupted image downloads. We have since
patched the 1.88 release to fix this issue.

In line with the recent rules update, the Planeswalker Uniqueness rule is
removed and the Legendary supertype added to existing planeswalkers.

In addition, this release includes 10 bug fixes and 175 new cards.
