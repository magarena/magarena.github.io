In 1.67, we introduced a proxy image generator to create a usable card image
when no downloaded images are found. In this release, we have upgraded this
feature to render realistic card images using proper card frames and fonts.

Text mode is now deprecated, as development focus has been on the image mode.
In this release, text mode is hidden and needs to be manually enabled via the
settings dialog. In the next release, we plan to remove text mode permanently.
If you would like text mode to remain, please let us know on the issues page at
https://github.com/magarena/magarena

Thanks to improvements to the card script engine, more cards can be supported
without groovy code. This release includes 87 new cards and 16 bug fixes.
