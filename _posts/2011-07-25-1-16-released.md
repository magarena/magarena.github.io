---

Time of the month for another release of Magarena. In version 1.16, the GUI should be much more responsive when playing against the computationally intensive Monte Carlo AI and you can now play against a variant of the Minimax AI that cheats. See the [README](http://code.google.com/p/magarena/source/browse/release/README.txt?r=1b3212f2195cbf7aed652561dc7f6d173daa8054) file for a more detailed changelog. -- melvin
