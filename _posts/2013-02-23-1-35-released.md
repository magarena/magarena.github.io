title: "1.35 released"
---


This release fixed six bugs and added 94 cards, many from the recent set. A
major new feature is the support for multiple activated abilities while a card
is in hand, making it possible to implement mechanics such as cycling,
bloodrush, and overload.

A number of cards which used to be built into the binary was converted to use
Groovy script to provide more examples of Groovy scripting in the
Magarena/scripts folder.
