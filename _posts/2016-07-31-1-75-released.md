title: "1.75 released"
---

In this release, we started to go over all missing cards and indicate if they
could be implemented with groovy code or they were not supported. This is done
by adding a status property to the card script. Out of the 4835 missing cards,
3470 have been annotated with the status properly.

We have also fixed five bugs and added 196 new cards, many from the Eldritch
Moon expansion.
