This release improves the log and stack by turing references to
cards/permannents into interactive links. Putting the mouse over an link will
highlight the card/permanent. Clicking the link will show the full size card
image.

We plan to stop supporting Java SE 7 which has reached end of life on April
2015. Please upgrade to Java SE 8. An alert prompt will appear on the main
screen if are currently using Java SE 7.
