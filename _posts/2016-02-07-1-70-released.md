The proxy image generator is able to make use of cropped card images in
creating the proxy image. Image download has been enchanced to allow
downloading of cropped images, though not every card has a cropped image.

When multiple image files are present for a card, the image used is based on
the following priority: custom > crops > cards/tokens > missing proxy.

Card abilities that reduce/increase mana cost of cards can now be scripted in
groovy code. However, additional costs such as kicker and buyback are not
affected by mana cost reduction.

Finally, this release adds 225 new cards and fixes 28 bugs.
