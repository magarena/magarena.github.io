Spanish joins the list of supported UI translations in this release. The deck
editor now accepts deck files in additional formats, such as the Forge deck
format. Decks containing unsupported cards can be used but the unsupported
cards will not be in your library.

It is possible to activate an ability but get stuck when paying the costs.
Previously, if the cost requires a certain permanent and it was not available,
the cost was ignored.  This has been fixed and in the same situation, the
player will have to undo.

In addition, this release includes 157 new cards, many from the recent Hours of
Devastation set. We have also fixed 15 bugs.
