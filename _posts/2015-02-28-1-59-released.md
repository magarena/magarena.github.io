This release adds 72 new cards and proper support for modal effects. A new AI
based on MTD(f) is currently being tested, and modifications were made to the
MCTS AI to improve how it plays when it is on the losing end.

A major refactor effort to separate the UI from the core game engine was
completed. This will make it easier to update or add new UIs in the future.
