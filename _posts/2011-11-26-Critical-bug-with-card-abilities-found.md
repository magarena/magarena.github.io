title: "Critical bug with card abilities found"
---

A critical bug with the way abilities are implemented as been found. Release 1.20 has been deprecated and we are working on a fix. This bug is caused by the recent change to support additional abilities in the engine that violated an earlier assumption on the maximum number of abilities. Our apologies for the oversight.

Thanks to Aswan jaguar, jeffwadsworth, and Suislide2k1 for reporting the bug.
