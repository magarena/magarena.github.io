and fixed the following bugs

 * Ulvenwald Bear's was using Festerhide Boar's ability
 * Nibilis of the Breath's ability cost {U} not {W}
 * Havengul Vampire gets -1/-1 instead of +1/+1
 * Malignus' power and toughness computed wrongly

The color property in the card script is now derived from the cost if it is not specified.
