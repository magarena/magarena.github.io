title: "1.49 released"
---


This release includes 476 new cards and adds support for casting and activating
cards from the graveyard. We have also greatly expanded our card scripting and
edited many of the existing card scripts to use the original rules text. In
addition, you can now import various user generated data as well as download
images from a previous install of Magarena.
