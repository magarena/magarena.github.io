In collaboration with Project Firemind, we've added a feature that lets you run
duels from Project Firemind on your computer. You'll first need to obtain your
access key from your Project Firemind profile page, then enter it in Settings
-> Run Firemind Worker.

The deck editor now provides a tabbed view that is simpler, less cluttered, and
scales down to smaller screens. We've also improved the visual indicators in
the duel screen to make it easier to follow the actions.

Finally, we've added the ability to skip till end of turn for times when you
have no other moves to make in the current turn. You can activate this by Shift
clicking the action button, clicking the action button with the right mouse
button, or using the keyboard shortcuts Shift+Space or Shift+Right arrow.
