title: "1.20 released"

On this Black Friday, the dev team (beholder, melvin, and wait321) brings you a new release of Magarena. This release fixed a number of errors in the cards, added 154 new cards, and moved card scripts to data folder. 

Intrepid users can now add simple cards by writing their own card script, putting the file in the Magarena/scripts folder and restarting the program. Many cards still require writing custom Java code but we hope to make more cards scriptable in the future. Documentation about the card script with be posted shortly.
