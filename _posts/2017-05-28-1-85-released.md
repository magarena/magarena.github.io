We have improved the rendering of permanents on the field making the
application a lot smoother when there are many permanents on battlefield.  The
vertical zone menu located in the hand area has been removed in favor of the
zone buttons on the playar avatar menu. In addition, seven bugs were fixed and
three new cards added.
