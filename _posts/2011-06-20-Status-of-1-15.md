title: "Status of 1.15"
---


Update: The download for 1.15 has been taken down as I have not gotten permission for a new component of the program. Not to worry, version 1.15 will be available once that is resolved.

Version 1.15 is ~~released~~ coming soon. There are 14 new cards and the cards have been reorganized into standard, extended, legacy cubes and all (vintage) cubes.

1.15 includes two core engine changes to the combat damage phase and state-based actions to fix two long standing issues ([issue 7], [http://code.google.com/p/magarena/issues/detail?id=11&can=1 issue 11](http://code.google.com/p/magarena/issues/detail?id=7&can=1)). The game also tries to skip certain steps more intelligently so there is less clicking to pass priorirty.

For more details, please read the [README](http://code.google.com/p/magarena/source/browse/release/README.txt?r=6d382971bc56c24015f32e004a1b20ed01a2ff50) file -- melvin
