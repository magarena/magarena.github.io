title: "1.61 released"

Please note that the duel save format has changed in this release and it is not
able to load a duel saved with a previous version. Three crash bugs and many
other card specific bugs were fixed in this release. Improvements to our oracle
text parsing and card contributions from the community enabled us to add 173
new cards.
