This release extends the card script to support more rules text, notably
transform cards, flips cards, and the morph mechanic. There are 673 new cards
added this release thanks to the work of all the card contributors.

You can now download images for unimplemented cards from the download images
dialog and upgrade low quality images to high quality ones during the import
process.
