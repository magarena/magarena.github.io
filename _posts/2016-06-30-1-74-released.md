In this release, we add support for downloading card images in Korean where
available. The card explorer now shows unimplemented card images in color when
you mouse over it and a watermark on transform cards as a visual indicator.

The card scripting support is improved to support more abilities and effects
directly in the card script without groovy code. This improvement and other
contributions cumulated in 202 new cards.
