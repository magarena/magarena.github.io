This is a bug fix release for 1.20. 

  * fixed: creatures with scripted abilities were getting the wrong ones due to an engine bug
  * fixed: Vivid land loses counter even when tapping for the right mana
  * fixed: description of Searing Touch says it deals 3 damage when it should be only 1 damage
  * fixed: opening the Keywords/Readme screen would cause keyboard shortcuts to stop working
