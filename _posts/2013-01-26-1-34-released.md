title: "1.34 released"
---


This release fixed seven bugs and added 93 cards. A major feature of 1.34 is
the support for using Groovy to add card specific code. Before this, it was
necessary to put out a new release whenever new card specific code is added.
With the new Groovy support, new card specific code can be added by putting the
.groovy file in the scripts folder without any modifications to the program.
