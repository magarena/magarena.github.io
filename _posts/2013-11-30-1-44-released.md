Many users have expressed difficulty in following what is going on in a game.
This release includes a number of UI improvements to address this issue. In
particular, the message log is always visible in the area above the stack to
make it easier to see the last few actions.

The card script has been updated to allow more cards to be expressed in card
script without any Groovy code. For this release, our awesome scripters put
together 340 new cards.
