This release includes a new setting to download images on demands. when enabled
the program will download images only when they are needed. We have also
updated the About screen to be consistent with the rest of the UI.

Themes are now stored in the themes folder instead of the mods folder. If you
are using custom themes, please put them in the themes folder.

The card script has been updated to include mechanics from the upcoming set.
This release adds 165 new cards and fixes 18 bugs.
