The game now tracks the number of games you've played per deck and the result
of each match. This information allows us to create three new deck groups in
deck selection, namely: Popular, Recently played, and Winning.

In addition, the duel UI now shows the number of shield, poison, energy and
experience counters in the player panel.

This release includes 8 bug fixes and 4 new cards.
