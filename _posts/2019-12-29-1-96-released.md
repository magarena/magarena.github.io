We've improve testing of cards by systemically going through each card and testing it in a predefined scenario.

Effect message generation is only done when needed to reduce cost of message generation during AI processing.

Abilities riot, afterlife, adapt, and spectable have been added to the card script.

This release fixes 3 bugs and adds 2 cards.
