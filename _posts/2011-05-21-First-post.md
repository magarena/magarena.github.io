The mercurial repository is up and issues have been migrated over from the original site. 

*Developers wanted!* If you play Magic: The Gathering, know how to program in Java, and want to contribute to making this a better game, [join our mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/magarena/subscribe) and make a posting
. Or simply make a [server side clone](http://code.google.com/p/magarena/source/clones) of the repository and start hacking. -- melvin
