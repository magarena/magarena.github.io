title: "1.68 released"
---

The inablity to recreate user reported gameplay issues, such as AI misplays,
has been a major obstacle for us. This release includes the ability to generate
a "Gameplay Report" in the game menu (accessed with the Esc key during the
game). Please include the generated gameplay report zip file when reporting
gameplay issues. In addition, we have fixed 20 bugs and added 71 cards.
