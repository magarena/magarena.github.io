title: "1.17b released"
---

This is a bug fix release to patch a critical bug in the sound system. There is
a bug in 1.17 that caused the game to crash whenever a sound effect is played,
this has been fixed. Thanks to Huggybaby's bug report on the forum.

We have also added a crash log to the game. Whenever the game crashes, it will
write some logging data to Magarena/crash.log. Please send us this file when
reporting game crashes.

As a small bonus, there are about 30+ new cards in this bug fix release. 

See [README](//github.com/magarena/magarena/blob/1.17.1/release/README.txt) for the full changelog. -- melvin
