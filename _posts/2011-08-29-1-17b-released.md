title: "1.17b released"

This is a bug fix release to patch a critical bug in the sound system. There is a bug in 1.17 that caused the game to crash whenever a sound effect is played, this has been fixed. Thanks to Huggybaby's bug report on the forum.

We have also added a crash log to the game. Whenever the game crashes, it will write some logging data to Magarena/crash.log. Please send us this file when reporting game crashes.

As a small bonus, there are about 30+ new cards in this bug fix release. 

See [README](http://code.google.com/p/magarena/source/browse/release/README.txt?r=22f9948d325bcf1a2486346ae5cf8460e9b0f91d) for the full changelog. -- melvin
