The release includes 7 bug fixes, 1 premade deck, and 69 new cards. The game
engine has been updated to enforce the new Planeswalker and Legendary
uniqueness rule that will take effect on July 13. 

We have completed conversion of all cards to use Groovy code. Cards are
dynamically loaded from files in the Magarena/scripts folder. Changes to files
in this folder will take effect when you reload the program.
