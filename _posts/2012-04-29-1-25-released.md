title: "1.25 released"

1.25 marks the twelfth release of Magarena on this site, the first release was
1.14 back in 28th May 2011. Since then we've had one release on the last week
of each month.

April is a slow month for Magarena. We fixed two bugs, improved the Linux launch
script thanks to a user suggestion, and improved the Minimax AI.
