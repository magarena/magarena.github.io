This release adds the Russian translation for the UI. The performance of the UI
has also been improved by changing how the log and stack is rendered. The card
script has been extended to support mechanics for the upcoming set.  In
addition, 21 bugs were fixed, 33 prebuilt decks and 12 cards were added.
