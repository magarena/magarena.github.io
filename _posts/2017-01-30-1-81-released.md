title: "1.81 released"

This release includes cards from Aether Revolt and updates the
banned/restricted list to the January 20th revision.

The "Download card images" menu has been renamed to "Setup card images" and
users should configure how they want the cards to appear in game, either as
they are printed or rendered in game from the latest card frames.

A total of 108 cards were added and 8 bugs fixed, including a hard to track
down AI crash bug.
